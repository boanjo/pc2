# Water Control

The water control is built from a miltone etape liquid ruler and a few solenoids (one for the pond and pone for the garden plants micro drip system) for adding tap water and also measuring the water amount used.

You need to print a few parts with your 3D printer. I'm using PETG with support on most of the printouts so that it can resist the outdoor UV. I.m just doing basic sanding (paper and file) and then put some spray paint on it to look nice.

An Arduino Nano is used for the regulated loop and has some auto cut off for the water in some suspicious situations. Basically a high and low threshold is built in (and can be changed) and then the water control will try to keep that level. I've used this method for 6 years now and it successfully keep the water level +-5mm.

Some plumbing needed for the water, 2 solenoids (2x7$) and water flow sensor (~15$). To get a good pressure and a filter i've integrated it with a gardena micro drip system (~25$). And the plumbing parts are probably another 30-40$.

I've hidden the water control parts in 2 cement pots. This part of the system can be left out, and the only thing i do before winter time is to attach the compressor, open all the solenoids and blow the system "clean" of water.

Pretty easy to hide
