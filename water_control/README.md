# Water Control

The water control is built from a miltone etape liquid ruler and a few solenoids (one for the pond and pone for the garden plants micro drip system) for adding tap water and also measuring the water amount used.

An Arduino Nano is used for the regulated loop and has some auto cut off for the water in some suspicious situations. Basiclly a high and low threshold is built in (and can be changed) and then the water control will try to keep that level. I've used this method for 6 years now and it successfully keep the water level +-5mm.

Some plumbing needed for the watersolenoids. To get a good pressure and a filter i've integrated it with a gardena micro drip system.
