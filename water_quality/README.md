# Water Quality

The water quality is monitored with a set of sensors or probes from Atlas Scientific: Temperature, PH, ORP, DO and EC probes are connected to the carrier boards mounted on a Tentacle T1 MKII. The firmware is running on an Arduino UNO

On the RPI there is a serial2mqtt.py application running and as the name indicates it bridges between the serial commands and the mqtt GW.
