Poseidon - is a modular control setup for your garden pond for sensors and switches. Monitoring is done with the TICK stack (Telegraf, Influxdb, Chronograf and Kapacitor) accompanied by a python Flask webserver for the control and quick overview. All is (in my setup)  running on a raspberry PI 3B. The influxdb creates some CPU spikes but there is plenty of power over to serve the relevant stuff and UI experience is smooth.
