# Fishfeeder

I have built a number of feeders for my koi fishes over the year (first one in 2005 ;-)) but now i i finally found a way that i think is the perfect balance between price, quality and build effort. If you don't have a 3D printer i guess you can order one printed. There are PETG material needed for maybe $20-30, a simple DC continously rotating servo for ~$10, a wemos D1 mini for ~$8 some sewer pipe parts (or if you want your own tank) for another ~$15. So in total you should be able to produce it with ~$50 

The water control is built from a water level sensor (2 alternatives below) a few solenoids (one for the pond and pone for the garden plants micro drip system) for adding tap water and also measuring the water amount used. You need to print a few parts with your 3D printer. I'm using PETG with support on most of the printouts so that it can resist the outdoor UV. I.m just doing basic sanding (paper and file) and then put some spray paint on it to look nice.


The feeder next to the reed makes it more fun for the fishes (they are hunting like crazy in the reed) but also good to avoid getting too fast into the skimmer.

Here are the parts for the feeder:

Basic operation is like a pellets screw. The screw has a loose fit in the cylinder to reduce the fricton and there is no problem for the DC servo to rotate, pulling KOI pellets from the PVC tube.

The full unit except the PVC tube:

I didn't rough the surface enough the first time, but now it's good. Ideally add some PVD primer or other coler with specialized adhesion.

Here is a YouTube video from some of the building step and any programming needed.
