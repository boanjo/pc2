# Fishfeeder


You need to print a few parts with your 3D printer. I'm using PETG with support on most of the printouts so that it can resist the outdoor UV. I.m just doing basic sanding (paper and file) and then put some spray paint on it to look nice. The contruction is pretty simple with a screw that pulls out the pellets from the sewer pipe.

The power needed is small, hence a high torque DC servo is enough to drive it. I'm using a FS5103R continous rotatiting servo (~15$) with a Wemos D1 mini pro (~10$) to drive it.

The only "problem" (after 3 years) i've had with this construction is to get the paint to really stick to the PVC sewer pipes :D! Here once again i've stripped off the paint and rugged the surface to make it stick.

The fishes loves the small rattle from the feeder when it's time!
